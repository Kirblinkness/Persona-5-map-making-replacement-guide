SOFTWARE NEEDED:

Autodesk 3ds Max (I'm using 2021 but this should work on lower software versions)

GFD Studio by TGE: https://github.com/TGEnigma/GFD-Studio/releases

Mod Compendium/Aemulus:

Aemulus: https://github.com/TekkaGB/AemulusModManager

Mod Compendium: https://github.com/TGEnigma/Mod-Compendium/releases/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok with that out of the way, Let's get started!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start off by making a new mod in Aemulus or the Mod Compendium and inside of the data folder make a folder called "model" inside of your model folder, you want to make another folder named "field_tex" this is going to be used for putting your model in and compiling.

after you do this, open 3ds max

Let's create a plane and name it something like "Placeholder_Floor_01"

Now that you have your plane, lets make some basic needs for a room for example (Walls, Roof, Door etc.)

To make a door/wall go into "Create/AEC Objects" and both should be objects in there.

Once you've made the room you want to, we need to add cameras and lights so we can see the model and a camera just incase.

Now export your model as an FBX. I suppose you can also export as OBJ or DAE however I prefer FBX.

Let's import our map into Persona 5 now!

Go into GFD Studio and click file->New->Model

Now load your model.

Once you've loaded your model, Leave Version be and choose FieldTerrain.

Depending on your models position, Convert skin to Z up should be checked, as far as I've tested the rest should be optional.
(If they're checked by default, then leave them be.)

Okay! Time for the final step. 

Look at your model and make sure everything is alright (size, colors, rotation) Then click File->Save As-> then save as a .GFS with the name being one of the field names from dev_hdd0>game><Your regions Persona 5 title id>>USRDIR>data>model>field_tex. Example: f000_002_0.GFS

For Aemulus: put your .GFS file into AemulusPackageManagerVx.x.x > Packages > Persona 5 > (Your mod)> data > model > field_tex

For Mod Compendium: Mods> Persona 5> (Your mod) > data > model > field_tex

Now you're ready to use your maps! happy map modding!
